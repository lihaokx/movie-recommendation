# Movie recommendation system

This is a capstone project of [Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming) on Coursera. It is a tool that recommends movies to users according to their movie ratings. First, a user rates some movies according to his or her interests. Then, the code will calculate similarities between new users and existing users' reviews. Finally, system will recommend some movies with high scores of weighted averages. 

The recommendation system could be reached by this [link](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//capstone/recommender.php?id=WFx9MjTmtzvgdy). My code is responsible for the backend. Fontend is done by Coursera.
